## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS FROM PROMPT 1

### Top 6 Addictive Mechanisms (Strongest Evidence)
1. **Variable Ratio Reinforcement** - Intermittent rewards (AI ratings, tips)
2. **Zeigarnik Effect** - Incomplete tasks drive return visits
3. **Loss Aversion** - Streak systems prevent abandonment
4. **Tribal Rewards** - Social validation and status
5. **Endowment Effect** - Personalization creates attachment
6. **Flow State** - Balanced challenge/skill creates immersion

### Top 5 Feature Recommendations (Legal + High Engagement)
1. **AI Facial Landmark Reveal** - Variable reward, high session frequency
2. **Protagonist's Roadmap** - Zeigarnik effect, 30-day retention boost
3. **Jawline Consistency Streaks** - Loss aversion, high stickiness
4. **Aesthetic Potential AI Visualizer** - Endowment effect, high investment
5. **Archetype-Based Accountability Circles** - Tribal rewards, 90-day retention

### Critical Legal Requirements (Canada)
- ✅ **Biometric Data:** Express consent required, local-first storage recommended
- ✅ **Dark Patterns:** Illegal - no nagging, neutral design hierarchy
- ✅ **False Scarcity:** Only legal if literally true (real countdowns)
- ✅ **Minors:** High-default privacy, parental consent for under-13
- ✅ **Quebec Law 25:** PIA required, CAI notification 60 days prior

5. Competitive analysis
6. User acquisition/marketing strategy

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks to complete all planning

### Step 2: Technical Architecture Setup
**Action:** Based on roadmap decisions, set up development environment

**Key Requirements:**
- Local-first biometric storage (on-device)
- Privacy by Design architecture
- Real-time streak tracking
- AI facial analysis (on-device recommended)
- Social features (anonymized data)

### Step 3: Begin MVP Development
**Action:** Start building Phase 1 features with clear specifications

**Phase 1 Features:**
- AI Facial Rating Engine
- Daily Roadmap (Protagonist's Quest)
- Streak Counter with Freeze mechanics
- Subscription system (Free + Pro tiers)

---

## 📋 FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1: Core Engagement (MVP)
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-4

1. **AI Facial Rating Engine**
   - Basic landmark detection
   - 1-10 attractiveness score
   - Variable reward mechanism
   - **Legal:** Express consent flow required

2. **Daily Roadmap (Protagonist's Quest)**
   - 90-day transformation plan
   - Daily micro-tasks
   - Zeigarnik effect (incomplete = return)
   - **Legal:** Low risk

3. **Streak Counter**
   - Multi-dimensional streaks
   - "Streak Freeze" mechanics
   - Loss aversion triggers
   - **Legal:** No confirm-shaming

### Phase 2: Retention Systems (Month 2)
**Timeline:** Weeks 5-8

4. **Aesthetic Potential Visualizer**
   - AI-generated "future self"
   - Digital Vault storage
   - Endowment effect
   - **Legal:** "Not medical advice" disclaimer

5. **Progress Visualization**
   - Historical landmark graphs
   - Heatmaps of consistency
   - Investment cycles
   - **Legal:** Low risk

### Phase 3: Social Features (Month 3)
**Timeline:** Weeks 9-12

6. **Archetype Accountability Circles**
   - 5-10 person groups
   - Anonymized progress sharing
   - Social validation
   - **Legal:** Granular sharing controls, right to erasure

## ⚠️ CRITICAL LEGAL CHECKLIST

### Before Launch (Must Complete)
- [ ] Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) - Quebec Law 25
- [ ] CAI notification (60 days before biometric database)
- [ ] Express consent flow for biometric data
- [ ] Local-first biometric storage architecture
- [ ] Plain language privacy policy
- [ ] "Not medical advice" disclaimers
- [ ] Parental consent system (if targeting under-18)
- [ ] Break reminders and well-being dashboards

### Ongoing Compliance
- [ ] No dark patterns (neutral design hierarchy)
- [ ] Real-time countdown timers only (no fake scarcity)
- [ ] Granular privacy controls
- [ ] Right to erasure implementation
- [ ] Regular privacy audits

## 💰 REVENUE STRATEGY (Awaiting Prompt 2)

**Status:** Pending Prompt 2 research

**Expected Revenue Models:**
- Subscription tiers (Free/Basic/Premium)
- In-app purchases (streak freezes, advanced analysis)
- Premium feature gating
- Potential: Affiliate partnerships (grooming products)

**Target ARPU:** TBD (Prompt 2 will provide benchmarks)

---

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS (From Research)

### Engagement Targets
- **DAU/MAU Ratio:** >30% (research indicates achievable)
- **Day 1 Retention:** High (immediate value from AI rating)
- **Day 30 Retention:** High (roadmap + streaks)
- **Day 90 Retention:** High (social circles + investment)

### Legal Risk Targets
- **Regulatory Risk:** Low (all features pre-vetted as legal)
- **Compliance Score:** 100% (no grey areas)
- **User Trust:** High (privacy by design)

## 📚 REFERENCE FILES

- **Research Output (Prompt 1):** `01_RESEARCH/research-addictive-features.md`
- **Research Prompts:** `01_RESEARCH/research-prompts.md`
- **Specific Mechanics (NEW):** `02_IMPLEMENTATION/specific-mechanics.md` ⭐ **READ THIS**
- **Framework Analysis:** `02_IMPLEMENTATION/framework-priority-analysis.md`
- **This Action Plan:** `02_IMPLEMENTATION/action-plan.md`

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED

**Problem:** Current research is too general (high-level concepts only)  
**Solution:** Created deep dive into specific mechanics from Duolingo, FarmVille, TikTok, Instagram

**New Document:** `02_IMPLEMENTATION/specific-mechanics.md`
- Exact mechanics from proven apps
- Specific implementation details
- Ready-to-use code/design patterns
- Expected metrics based on real apps

**Action:** Read the specific mechanics document before implementation. It contains the actual "how" that the research document is missing.

---

**Next Action:** 
1. Read `02_IMPLEMENTATION/specific-mechanics.md` (specific implementation)
2. Run Prompt 2 in Gemini to get monetization strategy
3. Combine all three: Research + Specific Mechanics + Monetization = Complete Spec
