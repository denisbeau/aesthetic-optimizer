## ADVANCED USAGE: PROMPT CHAINING (Optional)

**KERNEL Principle:** "Chain multiple KERNEL prompts instead of writing complex ones."

If you want even more focused results, split this into 3-5 separate prompts:

**Prompt Chain Option 1:**
1. **Prompt A:** Market expansion pathways only (sections 1-2)
2. **Prompt B:** Revenue diversification only (section 3)
3. **Prompt C:** Platform evolution + international expansion (sections 4-5)
4. **Prompt D:** Valuation pathways + implementation roadmap (sections 6-7)

**Prompt Chain Option 2 (More Granular):**
1. Market expansion research (one prompt)
2. B2B revenue opportunities (one prompt)
3. Platform evolution strategy (one prompt)
4. International expansion (one prompt)
5. Valuation analysis (one prompt)

**Benefits of Chaining:**
- Each prompt has single, clear goal (better results)
- Easier to verify each section
- Can iterate on specific areas
- Faster token usage per prompt

**Use This Single Prompt If:**
- You want comprehensive overview in one document
- You need all pathways analyzed together
- You want to see relationships between strategies
